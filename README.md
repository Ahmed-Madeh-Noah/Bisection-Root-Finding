## üîç About the Project

This repository contains an implementation of the **Bisection Method** in C++. This project was created as an individual
assignment for the **Mathematical Foundations of Computing** course, part of my sophomore year studies in **AI and Data
Science** at the Faculty of Artificial Intelligence, Menoufia University, Egypt.

The goal of this project is to provide a clear understanding of the bisection method for solving nonlinear equations and
to demonstrate coding practices in C++.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Bisection Method Works

The Bisection Method is a numerical approach for solving equations of the form **f(x) = 0**. If you're unfamiliar with
this technique or want more detailed explanations, check out this excellent resource:
